# EventDriven Design

Modern architectures rely on short running processes.
Often processes rely on other processes' outcome and are therefore event-driven.
One tool, often used for this, is [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).

On my work we use very old and also vendor specific solution (see ["Current situation" section](#current-situation)) and need to migrate to a modern way. 

As far as I understood Kafka's way of working, I'm not sure if it is a real substitution for the system we use at my work.  
Therefore, I want to investigate this.
I will describe our current situation and then investigate if and maybe how it can be transformed into Kafka or if there is another, more fitting solution.
